Prosaic is artistic hobby software written by one person and as such is full of rough edges, lacking in tests, and poorly documented. that sucks! any and all contributions to improve the state of things or add new features are welcome and appreciated. nathanielksmith will review any issues or PRs, but please have patience since they tend to get to them in a matter of days instead of hours.
